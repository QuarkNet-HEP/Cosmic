    "QuarkNet CRMDs don't measure the energy of these secondary muons, either, at least not directly.  Recall how the CRMD works, though:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a cosmic ray muon passes through one of the scintillating detector panels, which causes it to emit light.  Then, this light is gathered by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) that converts it to a voltage.  The detector's data acquisition board (DAQ) notes the times when this voltage first crosses a certain value (called the threshold), and then it notes again when that voltage falls back below the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time that the voltage pulse spends above the threshold is called the \"time over threshold\", and it's recorded as a data column in the output threshold data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more energy a muon has, the more light it generates in the scintillation panel of the detector.  This additional light registers at the PMT for a longer duration, meaning that the voltage pulse it produces lasts for a longer duration, and thus the \"time over threshold\" value recorded by the DAQ is greater than for a lower-energy muon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the \"time over threshold\" value is *correlated* to the energy of the muon, and this correlatoin is a *positive correlation*: as one increases, so does the other.  This means that, while we can't assign an energy value in GeV to a cosmic ray muon using QuarkNet's CRMDs, we can reasonably compare the energies of different muon events by looking at the \"time over threshold\" value in the data."
