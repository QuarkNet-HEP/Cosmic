    "In September of 2011, scientists at the OPERA experiment in Italy announced publicly a result that, if true, would upend nearly all of the past century of physics.  Their detector had measured ghostly particles called neutrinos travelling faster than the speed of light, an observation that directly contradicts the special theory of relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most scientists, including those on the OPERA team itself, were certain that there must have been some mistake.  Indeed there was, but it was difficult to track down.  After 5 months spent reviewing their experiment's setup, GPS measurements, and data analysis techniques with a fine-toothed comb, the team finally identified two small equipment problems: A clock (one of many) was ticking slightly faster than it was supposed to, and the connector on a fiber-optic cable (also one of many) was loose, causing the signal it carried to be slower than expected.  After fixing these errors, their math was corrected: neutrinos travel slower than light after all, just like relativity requires.\n",

    "This infamous episode in particle physics is a good reminder of an important rule: **scientific researchers must understand how their measuring devices affect the data they gather and be able to communicate this clearly when reporting their observations to others.**"

Signals are delivered through cables and connectors from the detector panels to the data acquisition board (DAQ), and from the GPS unit to the DAQ.  Both the GPS unit and the DAQ itself contain clocks that, used together, allow the CRMD to measure the arrival of cosmic ray muons with timing as precise as 10 nanoseconds.  If these elements malfunction or if you don't know how to account for their effects, you may end up with nonsense data -- or, even worse, data that *looks* correct but is subtly flawed so that you end up with the wrong answer without knowing it."
