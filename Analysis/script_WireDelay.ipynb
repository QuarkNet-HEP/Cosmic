If you're not convinced, increase the number of lines returned by the `head` command until the pattern is clear.\n",

    "Last, we notice the most interesting thing: the rising and falling edge time values have changed!\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigating further, we can see that for each line of data, the output file `6119.2016.0104.1.wd` has values that are exactly `0.0000115740747569` greater than the corresponding value in the input file `6119.2016.0104.1.thresh`.  This time represents the *wire delay*: After a counter registers a hit, it takes a small amount of time for that signal to travel through the connector cable to the DAQ board, where it's recorded as data. The `WireDelay.pl` script adjusts the data for this, helping us make time comparisons between detectors as precisely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does `WireDelay.pl` know how much to adjust the rising and falling edge times by?  The answer is in the other input file, `6119.geo`.  We could examine it to see what it contains, but it's more fun to try to guess first!"
