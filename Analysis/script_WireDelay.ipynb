This time represents the *wire delay*: After a counter registers a hit, it takes a small amount of time for that signal to travel through the connector cable to the DAQ board, where it's recorded as data. The `WireDelay.pl` script adjusts the data for this, helping us make time comparisons between detectors as precisely as possible.\n",
