    "The DAQ allows the user to configure the exact conditions - channel coincidence, threshold, etc. - under which an event is recorded as data.  Under typical configurations, a PMT signal in one channel causes the DAQ to open a \"gate\" for a certain time interval, during which it records all signals on all channels.  If more PMT signals arrive during this gate, their data is recorded as part of the initial event that triggered the gate.  Thus, a single \"event\" may comprise multiple muon detections and multiple raw data lines."

    "There are two sources of timing information used in the CRMD: that of the Global Positioning System (GPS), provided by an external receiver, and that of the DAQ's onboard Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **GPS** signal is a UTC time measurement that's the only source of absolute timescale in the CRMD system.  It is precise only to the millisecond, however, which is insufficient to handle the micro- and nanosecond physics of cosmic ray muon events, especially when comparing different DAQs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CPLD** clock operates at 25 MHz, meaning that it increments its reading by one digit every 40ns.  It has a 32-bit storage register typically given in hexadecimal; after counting ticks up to 2<sup>32</sup> = (4,294,967,296)<sub>10</sub> = (FFFFFFFF)<sub>16</sub>, it rolls over to 1 and starts again.  At 40ns per tick, this means that its full time range for one cycle is 171.798691800s, or not quite three minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though more precise than the GPS clock, the CPLD lacks any absolute time data.  During a standard CRMD data-aquisition run of one or more hours, the CPLD by itself can only record events relative to its current ~3min cycle.  The challenge of the CRMD timing system is in correlating the CRMD to the GPS signal: we use the CPLD to determine the time of a physical event within a ~3min window, in principle to 40ns precision, and then use GPS data to determine the absolute UTC time of this window.  This allows us to record data on cosmic ray muon incidence at the detector with a precision of 10s of nanoseconds."
